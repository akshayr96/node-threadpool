This project is mostly experimental and the API is subject to change.\nThis package implements thread pools using node 10.5's new worker thread API (see: https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html).\nIt supports an easy to use Promise based API to spawn and transfer data to and from threads.\nUnlike cluster or other similar node threading libraries, worker threads are native threads and support message passing as well as shared memory and atomic operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Start\nWith npm,\nnpm i node-threadpool\nOr with yarn,\nyarn add node-threadpool\nThen,\nimport { Executors } from \"node-threadpool\";\n\n// creates a thread pool with 4 threads\nconst pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);\n\n// these execute in parallel (as long as the pool size >= 2)\nconst result1 = pool.submit(async () => \"done 1\");\nconst result2 = pool.submit(async () => \"done 2\");\n\nconsole.log(await result1); // joins and prints

The package contains a single export, Executors.\nimport { Executors } from \"node-threadpool\";\n\nExecutors contains several methods to instantiate new thread pools. For a full list of methods, see the Executor API documentation.\nTo create a new thread pool, call one of the methods:\nconst pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4); // creates a pool with 4 threads\n\nThe pool is ready to use and functions can be executed in a worker thread by calling submit(...). For example,\nimport { Executors } from \"node-threadpool\";\n\n// creates a thread pool with 4 threads\nconst pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);\n\n// these execute in parallel (as long as the pool size >= 2)\nconst result1 = pool.submit(async () => \"done 1\");\nconst result2 = pool.submit(async () => \"done 2\");\n\nconsole.log(await result1); // joins and prints \"done1\"\nconsole.log(await result2); // joins and prints \"done2\"\n\nsubmit takes in a function which returns a promise. When the function has been run the promise is resolved and the result is returned.\nImportant: functions submitted to the thread pool cannot access data outside of the function's context. This includes imported modules which should be imported inside the function.\nSee the examples section for more examples on how to use the thread pool.\n"},"advanced-usage/":{"url":"advanced-usage/","title":"Advanced Usage","keywords":"","body":"Advanced Usage\n\nPassing Data\nSharing Data\n\n"},"advanced-usage/passing-data.html":{"url":"advanced-usage/passing-data.html","title":"Passing Data","keywords":"","body":"Passing Data\nWorker threads can only access data within the thread's (or the submmited functions) context. In order to operate on data in the main thread, data must be copied from the main thread to each worker thread which needs to access it.\nThis can be done by passing in a second argument to submit(...). The value in the second argument will be copied over to the worker thread and is passed into the submitted function.\nNote that since this is a copy of the data, any writes to the data in the worker thread are not reflected in the main (original) thread's data. Instead return results from the runnable function.\nSome examples:\nCopy a String\nconst pool = Executors.newSingleThreadedExecutor();\n// the string \"string to copy\" is passed to the worker thread and accessible via the data argument\nconst result = pool.submit(async data => data, \"string to copy\");\nconsole.log(await result); // prints \"string to copy\"\n\nCopy an Object\nconst pool = Executors.newSingleThreadedExecutor();\nconst map = new Map();\nmap.set(\"key\", \"value\");\nconst data = {\n  map\n};\n// the object is passed to the worker thread and accessible via the data argument\nconst result = pool.submit(async data => data.map.get(\"key\"), data);\nconsole.log(await result); // prints \"value\"\n\nMost plain javascript object types are supported when copying data.

Unlike copying data, sharing data allows threads to read and write each other's results (and also avoids the copy overhead).\nBe aware that writing to the same piece of data can be dangerous if the data is written to at the same time. The Atomics API can help with this.\nData can be shared with worker threads in the same way data can be copied to the worker threads. If the type of data is SharedArrayBuffer it will be shared instead of copied.\nFor example,\nconst buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(1 * Int32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT);\nconst array = new Int32Array(sharedBuffer); // provide a view onto the buffer\n\n// theres no lock, so in order to write safely we'll use one thread for this toy example\n// see the next example for atomic usage\nconst pool = Executors.newSingleThreadedExecutor();\n\n// set the data in the shared buffer to 42\nawait pool.submit(async d => (new Int32Array(d)[0] = 42), buffer);\n\n// read the data from the shared buffer\nconst result = pool.submit(async d => new Int32Array(d)[0], buffer);\n\nconsole.log(await result); // prints 42\n\nThe examples section contains more examples, including an example of using Atomics.\n"},"examples/":{"url":"examples/","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"Examples\n\nBasic Usage\nPassing Data\nShared Array Buffers\nAtomics\n\n"},"examples/basic-usage.html":{"url":"examples/basic-usage.html","title":"Basic Usage","keywords":"","body":"Basic Usage\nTo submit work to a thread pool, create a method which returns a promise.\nIn this example, the method is declared inline and returns a Promise.\nAfter completion of work, the thread pool resolves the promise with the value.\nWe use await to wait until the result is available then print it to console.log.\nconst pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);\nconst result = pool.submit(async () => \"hello world\");\nconsole.log(await result); // prints \"hello world\"\n\n"},"examples/passing-data.html":{"url":"examples/passing-data.html","title":"Passing Data","keywords":"","body":"Passing Data\nThread pool functions cannot access data outside of the function's context. This is because the worker runs in a separate thread and cannot access data in the main thread.\nThe easiest way to get data into the worker thread is to copy it. This can be done by providing submit two arguments (the first is the runnable function, the second is the data to copy).\nMost standard data is supported. Class instances and data with circular references notably are not supported.\nNote that each worker receives a copy of the data -- changes made within each thread do not affect the original data.\nIn the following example, a Map is copied into the worker thread for data access.\nconst pool = Executors.newSingleThreadedExecutor();\nconst map = new Map();\nmap.set(\"key\", \"value\");\nconst data = {\n  map\n};\nconst result = pool.submit(async d => d.map.get(\"key\"), data);\nconsole.log(await result); // prints \"value\"\n\n"},"examples/shared-array-buffers.html":{"url":"examples/shared-array-buffers.html","title":"Shared Array Buffers","keywords":"","body":"Shared Array Buffers\nNode's worker_thread API supports shared memory between threads.

This integer is then written to in the first thread, and read and returned in the second thead. Note that we could also read and write to the same buffer from the main thread.\nAlso note that a single thread executor is used to avoid concurrent threads reading and writing to the same memory at the same time (see the next example using Atomics which does this safely).\nconst buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(1 * Int32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT);\nconst array = new Int32Array(sharedBuffer); // provide a view onto the buffer\n\n// theres no lock, so in order to write safely we'll use one thread for this toy example\n// see the next example for atomic usage\nconst pool = Executors.newSingleThreadedExecutor();\n\n// set the data in the shared buffer to 42\nawait pool.submit(async d => (new Int32Array(d)[0] = 42), buffer);\n\n// read the data from the shared buffer\nconst result = pool.submit(async d => new Int32Array(d)[0], buffer);\n\nconsole.log(await result); // prints 42\n\n"},"examples/atomics.html":{"url":"examples/atomics.html","title":"Atomics","keywords":"","body":"Atomics\nFor threads to access and write to the same elements in SharedArrayBuffers, Atomic operations are needed (ex. to implment locks and mutexes).
